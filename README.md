Topic : Air qulity index predication 

Introduction
*The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is.

*The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.

*The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality

what to do : 

To identify the Most polluted City based on AQI value

*Create a Model to Predict the quality of air(Classification to various category like Good, moderate, etc)

Objective: 

*The objective of the Air Quality Index (AQI) is to provide a standardized and easily understandable way to communicate the quality of the air in a specific location, reflecting the concentration of various pollutants.

Working:

Data Collection and Integration

*Data Preprocessing

*Visualization

*Forecasting

Tools used: 

1python
2numpy
3pandas

5sklearn 

Scope in air quality index 

*Environmental Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of air quality is essential for understanding pollution levels and their impact on public health. 

*Health Impact Assessment: Investigating the health effects associated with different AQI levels provides valuable insights

*Urban Planning and Design: City planners can use AQI data to inform urban development and design.

*Emergency Response and Preparedness: AQI is crucial during environmental emergencies, such as wildfires or industrial accidents

Conclusion: 

*In conclusion, developing predictive models for estimating Air Quality Index (AQI) is a significant undertaking with the potential to positively impact public health awareness.
 
*By leveraging meteorological data, pollution sources, and geographical features, these models can provide valuable insights into air quality conditions. The process involves meticulous steps, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment
